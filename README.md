## Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network for Video Classification

### Overview
This project involves the development of a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) model for the classification of videos based on human activities. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, the LRCN is capable of spatially and temporally analyzing video frames to accurately predict the activities being performed.
